A warning message would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nI don't think an option to delete also JOOMLA user is a good idea. EasySDI should not be able to delete JOOMLA user.\r\n\r\nAs we can't add an easySDI user without creating a JOOMLA user, we should not be able to delete a JOOMLA user throw EasySDI.",

If it is the case, admin should not be able to delete it and a message should explain why : \r\n- Ressources are linked to the user\r\n- Command are linked to the user\r\n- etc...\r\n\r\nOk for your Dialog proposition Yves.",

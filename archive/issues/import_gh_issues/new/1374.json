Is there any possiblity to enter a link for each language present in joomla (e.g. french and german)? If not, is that a possible enhancement?"

It does not support translation.\r\n\r\n+It would need a small dev to make it multilingual.+\r\n\r\nI suppose it has not been done because the rest of the SHOP (Basket etc) is not fully multilingual.\r\n\r\nDo you use SHOP for download only, or do you plan to use it with the full basket functionality ?",

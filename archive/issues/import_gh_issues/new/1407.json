Also the ones containing only 'automatic mining' products.\r\n\r\nReasons are :\r\n* Providers using automated extractions can't see they're diffusion history online\r\n* Providers with mixed diffusion (automatic\/manual) have a partial history\r\n* Providers migrating from manual to automatic loose the visibility on diffusion history\r\n* provider can't see if any request is pending in error (error with the REST transaction etc...)\r\n\r\nThe _requests_ view wont' change, only have more items if there's any 'full auto' orders. The _request_ view is ready (no big change needed).\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.5.0"

If one selected, three extra fields will appear below (see basket layout attached in #643 ). \r\n\r\nProblems :\r\n\r\n- I do not see them\r\n- I know the visibility of the 3 extra fields should be optionnal as decribed in specifications #644 BUT I do not find the option in backend. \r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.0"

With the establishment of the offer, the three fields were supposed non-persisted, but I realize now that the specifications might lacked details about it.\r\n\r\nCan you confirm if these fields should only be included in the notification email to thirdparty validator, or if they should also appear in various interfaces?\r\nIf necessary, thank you to list the relevant interfaces.",

We told Bruno we will do it later. It was not part of the dev. to do.\r\n\r\nWhas is actually missing is the option in backend \"visibility of the 3 extra fields\" as described in the ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

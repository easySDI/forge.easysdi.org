It does not allow to type a long text in an easy way, especially if ones would like to add simple HTML anchors like <br>, <b> or <i>\r\n\r\nA multiline field was added for Joomla! 1.5 (see #501)\r\n\r\nA better enhancement (but incompatible with J! 1.5) would be to add some simple features for text formatting like below :\r\n\r\n!mootools-MooEditable-simple.PNG!\r\n(example with MooEditable, done with Mootools -> http:\/\/cheeaun.github.com\/mooeditable\/)\r\n\r\nQuestions from Bruno to be addressed before doing it :\r\n\r\n\r\n* How do you plan to implement loading new Mootools API version and MooEditable API; there is a global way in EasySDI V2 of adding multiple Javascript API with a common loader and it would be nice to use such mecanism, if there isn't any some problem with such logical. Can you tell us more about that?\r\n* Joomla 2.5 integrates Mootools 1.4 so such functionality will be normally available with EasySDI V3; is it correct?\r\nWe should not forget to remove Mootools 1.3 version in EasySDI V3; can you please add such issues affected to CATALOG V3?\r\nCan you please confirm that such new feature will be applied only to edition tooltip\r\n* Is there no way using any Joomla editor (tinyMCE, JCE, ...) for such feature?\r\n"

Notes under the figure.\r\n\r\n!on_delete.png!\r\n\r\n*[note1]* @jos_sdi_pricing_order_supplier_product_profile[pricing_profile_id] -> jos_sdi_pricing_profile[id]@ : Should not CASCADE, the point of the jos_sdi_pricing_order_* tables is to keep the history, even if a profile changes, or is deleted. I suggest to change to *SET NULL*.\r\n*[note2]* @jos_sdi_diffusion[pricing_profile_id] -> jos_sdi_pricing_profile[id]@ : SET NULL seems to be correct, BUT we should not be able to delete a profile if a diffusion is active (need a check in PHP)\r\n*[note3]* we should not be able to delete a @jos_sdi_diffusion@, we have to delete a resource, and there is a check in PHP, I propose to leave it as is.\r\n*[note4]* we should not be able to delete a @jos_sdi_organism@ if there is a resource attached, I propose to leave it as is.\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.5.0"

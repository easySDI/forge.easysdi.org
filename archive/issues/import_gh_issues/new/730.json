I think he should only see its own ressources (same list than in the resource list). \r\n\r\nAre you ok with that?\r\n\r\nThomas"

In your example (Resource link), I can be in organism A and see all contacts from others organism. The idea is not to restrict access to users own resources but to users organims' resources only.\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nAbout replication, the interface allows users filtering resources he wants and we could add complementary filters like toggle buttons \"Resources\" (\"All\" or \"Mine only\").\r\n```\n\r\n\r\nGood idea... \r\n\r\n",

Here is our proposal :\n\n* Concerning \"linking resources between themselves through their metadata\"\n*Current situation* : any user can access to any contact of any organism\n*Target* :\n- any user can access only contacts according to their scope of any organism \n- add in the contact list (when editing metadata) the name of the organism after the name of contact (to avoid homonym confusion)\n- in back-end (see \"relations_screen.png\":https:\/\/forge.easysdi.org\/attachments\/download\/711), in the edition of a relation in metadata model, add two options when the child type is \"resource type\"\n(1) only show resources of the user's organism \n(2) only show resources belonging to the organism of the metadata currently edited\nremark : both options can be set to \"true\". By adding theses options, the admin can limit the list of child resource available to the user when editing metadatas.\n\n* concerning \"importing metadata from another resource\"\n*Current situation* : any user can access to any resource of any organism and filters on \"status\", \"name\" and \"resource type\".\n*Target* :\n- any user can access only resource according to their scope of any organism \n- add a new filter \"organism\" with \"my organism\" set by default\n- the filter \"resource type\" should be set by default to the resource type currently in edition \n\n\nThere is a third case :\n\n* concerning \"relation between resources\"\n*Current situation* : any user can add a relation between its resource and others resources of any organism and filters on \"status\", \"name\" \"id\" and \"resource type\".\n*Target* :\n- at least apply scopes as well... \n- need some input from Berne maybe ?\n",

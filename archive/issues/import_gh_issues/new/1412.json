To be compliant with ISO 19115, we have to include a gmd:url element in gmd:linkage.\r\n\r\nI would like to add an option in the stereotype \"file\" to choose the element to include in the xml. If nothing is stored, the gco:CharacterString should be used.\r\n\r\nDo you think it's the right way to do this."

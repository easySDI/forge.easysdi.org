This leads to \"non-natural\" UX behavior.\r\nThe main problem is that *we cannot \"cancel\" perimeter edition*.\r\n\r\nWe have described 4 use cases: all 4 start with a user that sets a perimeter, saves, then go back to edit popop. Then:\r\n1) Do not change perimeter and save\r\n2) Do not change perimeter and do not save (cancel)\r\n3) Change perimeter and save\r\n4) Change perimeter and do not save (cancel)\r\n\r\n\r\nCases 2 and 4 fails, as the previously defined perimeter is lost on cancel.\r\n\r\nThis is a big issue for us, as we have users selecting dozens of WFS perimeters or drawing complex polygons (then eventually loosing it all).\r\n\r\n*Graph that presents our thinking on how it should behave:*\r\n\r\n!map_perim_defect_rev2.png!\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.0"

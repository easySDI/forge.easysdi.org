Such new feature will allow administrators storing their IDS information in same relational database than their metadata or geographical data.\r\n\r\neasySDI is already based on data access layer through \"Joomla data access layer\":http:\/\/docs.joomla.org\/Accessing_the_database_using_JDatabase (PHP) and \"Hibernate ORM\":http:\/\/hibernate.org\/orm\/ (JAVA).\r\nSo the goal is to be able to deploy easySDI under each Joomla supported database (MySQL, SQL Server, SQL Azur, Postgresql).\r\n\r\n\"Geneva Airport\":http:\/\/www.gva.ch is interested in sponsoring the SQL Server compliance (and defacto SQL Azur), \"DEPTH\":http:\/\/www.depth.ch offers to sponsor Postgresql compliance.\r\n\r\nAs easySDI Community is ready to go implementing such feature, may I ask you to vote for it ?\r\nThanks a lot!\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.1.0"

Does this proposal will cover this task ?\r\n* this cross-database compliancy means that any new developement must be tested with the three database (it means all developers needs the three environment). I see a problem here : how can we get this done for any new dev. or change ?\r\n* strategy : do you plan to override Joomla framework for requests which needs adaptations ? or do you plan to commit change to the J! framework ? the second option would be better if we think in long-term, no ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answers.\r\n\r\nXavier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This need is much more important as multiple databases will be supported with cross-database feature.\r\nIt will also simplify verification process about ordering component deployment!\r\n\r\n",

It extend the current log maintenance options.\r\n\r\nIf we add an \"auto delete\" option, I would suggest to made it available as well for the log (so far, it's done manually -> as you suggest in your point 1.)\r\n\r\nHum... I am wondering as well if logs and pictures should not be managed all together ?\r\nIs there any need to keep logs longer in the databse than the pictures ?? for space issues I guess...",

Now, if CSW is down, there is just no answer which is quite unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThis message should be visible in two places :\r\n\r\n- front end of the CATALOG, when a search in performed (to be exact when result should be exposed)\r\n- front end of the CATALOG, when metadata details (ViewMetadata) are displayed.\r\n\r\nThe default text could be something like \"Metadata server is currently unavailable for maintenance reasons. Thanks for your understanding\"."

If CSW is down, the user is inform and remained in the update panel. With this mechanism, he would not loose his job.",

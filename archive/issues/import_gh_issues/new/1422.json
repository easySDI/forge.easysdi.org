Is it really necessary ?\r\n\r\n__I tested it and when copying the password by selecting it with a double-clic, it added an extra \"space\" at the end to the string which leads to wrong password copied in the interface.\r\nI happens to me... and may happen to others as well._ \r\n\r\nThomas, why not considering a shorter password to avoid this kind of \"problem\" ?\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.5.0"

If no diffusion is available, the user can always use the status \"published\/unpublished\".\r\n\r\n_by the way : this last status should be renamed as well. I suggest : \"Active \/ inactive\" or something equivalent._\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.0.2"

I would prefer to rename such button \"Empty\" and remove the saving process when clicking on it.\r\n\r\nAbout using status, another way could be to store properties even if the corresponding checkbox (download or extract) is unchecked. By this way, properties are stored and can be recovered when checkbox is checked again by user...\r\n\r\nChanging this issue as a feature will allow Community to validate such change before coding it.\r\n",

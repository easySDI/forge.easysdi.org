We see two different logic for doing this:\r\n\r\n* 1) Get and store name when editing *\r\nThis certainly is easier version, when a metadata is edited, the stereotype loads the resource name, and place it XML according to relations.\r\n- Problem: if a resource is renamed, the metadata will by unsynced, or we have to update the metadata in any way...\r\n\r\n* 2) Use proxy *\r\nThis one is trickier but more robust. On metadata edition, the stereotype place a special easySDI tag in proper place in XML. The name is not stored, but the proxy replaces the tag by the resource name on the fly when accessing the metadata.\r\n\r\nProblem in any cases: I think that the resource name is not multi-lingual, so this stereotype would be usable in single language environments."

Or an external CSW update? Alternative is to use this as a default value only.\r\n\r\n>this solution has to be inspected before any decision can be taken.",

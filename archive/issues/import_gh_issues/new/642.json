Can you tell us more precisely which future purposes you're thinking about or which other new feature are binded to ?\r\n\r\nAbout SHOP webservice, is it correct than you are waiting for that XML content must also described which categories the organism of the client or third party is member of ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your support!\r\n\r\n",

This is part of another feature (#643) that will be developped later this year in easySDI.\r\n# the organism's category can be used to add the organism\/client email to newsletter feature (not in easySDI) if one's want to send specific content to specific type of organism.\r\n# the organism's category can be used to distinguish between different kind of account on the platform. In our case (ASIT VD), we need to make a difference between \"member\" and \"not-member\". That will be two categories.\r\n```\n\r\nAbout SHOP webservice, is it correct than you are waiting for that XML content must also described which\r\ncategories the organism of the client or third party is member of ?\r\n```\n\r\nRight, the webservice should contain the information of the categorie(s) the client or third party belong to. This info could be used by the geodata supplier and therefore needed in the XML.",

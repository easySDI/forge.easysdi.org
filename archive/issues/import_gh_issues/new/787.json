(fortunately there's not a lot of them ;-) )\r\n\r\n* Not related to Crowdin, but some stings in esaySDI catalog have different prefix:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nCOM_EASYSDI_CATALOG_VALIDATE_AND_SAVE_ITEM=\"Valider et enregistrer\"\r\nCOM_EASYSDI_CATALOG_INPROGRESS_ITEM=\"En travail\"\r\nCOM_EASYSDI_CATALOGE_SEARCH=\"Rechercher\"\r\nCOM_EASYSDI_CATALOGE_THESAURUS_GEMET=\"Select Keywords\"\r\n```\n\r\n\r\n@COM_EASYSDI_CATALOGE@ ... with an \"E\", any technical reason to this ?\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.2.0"

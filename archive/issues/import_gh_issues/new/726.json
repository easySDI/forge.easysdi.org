BUT they are drawbacks :\n- if an administrator would like to point to another resource than \"article\", for example a special component, it would not be possible\n- if you want to specify an item ID (for menu and SEO), it's not automatic. By having a simple URL, the administrator can add parameters he wants in the URL.\n\nTo sum up, it's maybe less user-friendly (but it's for the admin !) but more flexible.\n",

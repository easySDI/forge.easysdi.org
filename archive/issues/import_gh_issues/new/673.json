The first step is to configure the server (PHP parameters) to allow upload file bigger than 30 Mo.\n\nSo the goal is to:\n- remove from installers all files which are not necessary (documentation, sample, old API which are not used anymore); keeping uncompressed Javascript files is important as it allow to trace javascript problem in Joomla debug mode...\n- add in preflight verification of environment to prevent any upload\/execution timeout (PHP ini memory_limit set to 32M, ...)\n- add in preflight verification of dependencies to prevent any misbehaviour (PHP CURL extension activated, ...)\n\nThen we can work on auto-update process...",

Why is there no toggle on this feature just like the others above ? --> if we do not need applications to link to a ressource, we should be able to disacticate it.\r\n\r\nI suggest to apply the same logical on the Application feature as we have with with \"diffusion\" feature : add a toggle in the BE to activate\/disactivate this feature.\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.2.0"

If lot of resources are published with other web applications (i.e. a specific web viewer), it is more convienient to let resource's manager filling in such parameters than a metadata editor.",

        "body": "**Original author :** Portier Thomas\n\nI think that we could merge the service and monitor components.\r\n\r\nIt could work like that :\r\n- Add a radio button in the definition of a service : Monitor (yes\/no). It will do a getCapabilities on the service.\r\n- Add global parameters in the service component to fix url of the monitor service, email to alert when a status service change, the frequency of the requests\r\n- Add a Monitor menu entry to display results of the monitoring with a selection of service monitored and a period that will display a D3 graph includind response time and status changes\r\n\r\nThe servlet works great, we could just keep it as it is"

See:\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nV4.2.X order status : we can use the archive state\r\n    +------+     +------+           +------+     +--------+\r\n    |      +---->+      +---....--->+finish+---->+archived|\r\n    +------+     +------+           +------+     +--------+\r\n\r\nV4.3.x oreder status : cannot use the archive status for views,\r\n                       since we cannot archive rejected orders\r\n                                    +-------------+\r\n                               .--->|rej. by supl.|\r\n                               .    +-------------+\r\n                               .\r\n    +------+     +------+      .    +------+     +--------+\r\n    |      +---->+      +---....--->+finish+---->+archived|\r\n    +------+     +------+      .    +------+     +--------+\r\n                               .\r\n                               .    +-------------+\r\n                               .--->+rej. by TP   |\r\n                                    +-------------+\r\n```\n\r\n\r\n## Implications\r\n\r\nIn the code:\r\n* add the boolean filter in orders view\r\n* only show active order in the 'last orders module' (#1078)\r\n* change the archive method controller, and allow it in view from any end status\r\n* remove archived status from constants and tests\r\n\r\nThe sql update plan is:\r\n* add the new field ( archived(boolean) )\r\n* set the archived flag to all orders that are in archived status\r\n* set status to 'finish' to all 'archived' orders (the only state they could have been in before!)\r\n* delete the archive status from the sys table\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.4.1"

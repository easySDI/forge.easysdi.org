Thus the layer hierarchy will still exist but the root layer will be never displayed.\r\n\r\nThis problem should not appear with WFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

BUT the user should just get the layers he has the right to see. Isn'it ?\r\n\r\nThe suggested \"evolution\" remain interesting... and might me done in a next release.\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

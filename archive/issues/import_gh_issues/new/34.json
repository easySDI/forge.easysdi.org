Example : 0, 400,0,600\r\n\r\nAn evolution of the proxy might be to support the following parameters (to discuss...) :\r\n- the ability to just define a \"max numbers of pixels\" for a given policy (the proxy then proceed to a calculation to verify if the window asked is within the limit of pixels given >> )\r\n- the question of error management is also important and should be taken into acccount : if the max pixels is reached, should the user received an error ? in which form ? etc...\r\n\r\n\r\nTo follow...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

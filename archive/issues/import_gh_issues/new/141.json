All of them will be published\/unpublished via modules and plugins (Joomla standard mechanism).\r\n- EasySDI package will be available with a set of default indicators that do not need any Java servlet installation or third party apps.\r\n- The HOME will be fully customizable via Modules, meaning an administrator will be able to add any third party modules (for example module \"connected users\") in the panel.\r\n- Advanced dashboard will be available via another componant DASHBOARD (not CORE) - description here #623\r\n",

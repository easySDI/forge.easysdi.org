The result is the loss of hierarchical navigation:\r\n- breadcrumb doesn't work\r\n- menus items aren't \"active\"\r\n\r\nWorking example:\r\nIf we edit a resource the hierarchy is kept: menu_entry -> resources -> one resource\r\n\r\nNon working example:\r\nIf we edit a diffusion we move from com_easysdi_core to com_esysdi_shop, and loose itemid. Navigation is broken.\r\n"

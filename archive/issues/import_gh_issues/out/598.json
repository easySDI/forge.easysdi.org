So we propose to \r\ngive up such feature inside the new EasySDI versions.\r\n\r\nMay I ask EasySDI Steering Committee to give back his advice and vote about removing such feature ?\r\n+1 = remove XQuery engine from EasySDI v3 / no advice\r\n-1 = keep XQuery engine inside EasySDI v3\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nBruno\r\n","start_date":"2013-02-19","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2013-02-19T11:45:22Z","updated_on":"2015-09-18T15:17:31Z","closed_on":"2014-04-04T13:21:03Z","journals":[{"id":2386,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"+1","created_on":"2013-02-19T11:45:30Z","details":[]},{"id":2387,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-02-19T11:46:05Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"132"}]},{"id":2388,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-02-19T11:46:12Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"132","new_value":"135"}]},{"id":2390,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"+ 1","created_on":"2013-02-25T11:17:24Z","details":[]},{"id":2391,"user":{"id":16,"name":"Portier Thomas"},"notes":"+1","created_on":"2013-02-25T21:06:46Z","details":[]},{"id":2393,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-02-26T16:13:51Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":2394,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-02-26T16:14:00Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"9","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"23"}]},{"id":2469,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-10-17T10:24:42Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"23","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"135","new_value":"138"}]},{"id":2470,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-10-17T10:24:50Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"12"}]},{"id":3061,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-04-04T13:21:03Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"12","new_value":"10"}]},{"id":6339,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"created_on":"2015-09-18T15:17:31Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"3"}]}]}}

Values would be days (integer), 0 is \"infinite\" (default).\r\nThis will allow easySDI to remove links from order summaries after the desired time (like we do with local stored files).\r\n","start_date":"2015-04-07","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2015-04-07T08:07:24Z","updated_on":"2016-04-27T14:19:57Z","journals":[{"id":5224,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-04-10T09:41:23Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"priority_id","old_value":"4","new_value":"5"}]},{"id":5230,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"Ok from TC.\r\n","created_on":"2015-04-10T09:56:26Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"7","new_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"762","new_value":"383"}]},{"id":6664,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-11-11T07:47:16Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"priority_id","old_value":"5","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":7620,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2016-04-27T14:19:57Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"383"}]}]}}

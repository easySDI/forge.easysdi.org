Another approach would be to say : we keep going with Highcharts for small-medium amount of data and use others tools (offline) to process big amount of data like you have for example.\r\n\r\nNeed to be discussed.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion ?\r\n","created_on":"2011-11-03T08:18:43Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"173"}]},{"id":1790,"user":{"id":173,"name":"Larsen de Martino Jorgen"},"notes":"I am for shifting to a flash library if that solves the issue. it might even bring some new exiting features to the graph section.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to have it inline in the Monitor component and only use the export option when you really want to play with data\r\n\r\nAs always - Depending on the cost off course :-)","created_on":"2011-11-03T15:29:03Z","details":[]},{"id":1793,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"Update :\r\n\r\nHere is an interesting discussion thread in Highcharts forum :\r\nhttp://highslide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7673&p=36045&hilit=thousand#p36045\r\n\r\nAnd when looking at Highcharts roadmap, new version for fall 2011 indicates \"Better performance in Highcharts with thousands of points\"\r\nhttp://www.highcharts.com/support/roadmap\r\n\r\n","created_on":"2011-11-08T22:15:54Z","details":[]},{"id":2843,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:34:42Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"10","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","old_value":"9"}]},{"id":2984,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-04-02T16:06:53Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"21"}]},{"id":3239,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-05-03T08:42:09Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"114"}]},{"id":3789,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-07-17T19:17:53Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"114"}]},{"id":7170,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"This is an old and very specific ticket & the community plans to make a large MONITOR refactoring.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this ticket is rejected.","created_on":"2016-02-03T15:01:35Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"tracker_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"173"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"}]}]}}

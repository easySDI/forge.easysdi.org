Openlayers can transform coordinates by itself between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:900913 but can not handle others SRS.\r\n\r\n- Proj4js library version currently embedded in EasySDI project (1.4.1), and used for extent definition in the metadata form, is not compatibe with the version of OpenLayers used in the map.\r\n\r\n- OpenLayers version used in the map (2.12) has a bug (managment of reverse axis order for WMS 1.3.0) which is always ran when SRS other than the 2 mentionned above are used. This bug is corrected in v2.13 (which is also not compatible with Proj4js 1.4.1).\r\n\r\nCorrection made :\r\n1/ Replace OL 2.12 by OL 2.13 in the MAP. \r\n2/ Add Proj4js 1.1.0 to EasySDI project.\r\n3/ Load Proj4js 1.1.0 in the MAP.\r\n\r\nConclusion : \r\nWe now have 2 versions of Proj4js and 2 versions of OpenLayers embedded in the EasySDI project.\r\nWe should replace the use of Proj4js 1.4.1 and Openlayers 2.12 by versions 1.1.0 and 2.13 every where in the project.\r\n","created_on":"2014-07-31T09:23:25Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"}]},{"id":3937,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-08-03T14:34:44Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"2"}]},{"id":3974,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-08-03T19:36:09Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":4027,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-08-25T12:09:24Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"810"}]},{"id":4038,"user":{"id":761,"name":"Battaglia Marc"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-08-25T12:20:31Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"10"}]},{"id":4451,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-12-12T16:01:31Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"156","new_value":"159"}]},{"id":4492,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-12-12T16:05:27Z","details":[{"property":"cf","name":"2","old_value":"155","new_value":"159"}]},{"id":6254,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"created_on":"2015-09-18T15:15:47Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"23"}]}]}}

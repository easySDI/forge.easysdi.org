It does not support translation.\r\n\r\n+It would need a small dev to make it multilingual.+\r\n\r\nI suppose it has not been done because the rest of the SHOP (Basket etc) is not fully multilingual.\r\n\r\nDo you use SHOP for download only, or do you plan to use it with the full basket functionality ?","created_on":"2016-10-14T14:15:28Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"885"}]},{"id":7967,"user":{"id":885,"name":"Schaer Peter"},"notes":"Hi Yves\r\n\r\nwe only use the SHOP for download and we have an acceptable workaround (linking to a pdf file containing informations in both languages).

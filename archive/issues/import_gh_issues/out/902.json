Nice!\r\n2: It would *avoid developing some backend/admin features/screens*, they could just be added in frontend, only available to this role.\r\nThis logic should be applied, not only to resources, but to other screens, like validation, for example : in the 4.3.x validation process we have mail sent to thrid party. A good admin feature would be \"resent notification\". With this role, no need to add anything in backend.","created_on":"2015-02-18T10:22:32Z","details":[]},{"id":4851,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-06T09:02:27Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"895"}]},{"id":5071,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"I agree with Xavier that \"organism\" filter and \"organism membership\" info should be added in frontend and backend if it's missing!\r\n\r\nThanks TC to vote on such issue which is part of #895","created_on":"2015-03-18T07:43:51Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"7"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"23","new_value":"762"}]},{"id":5074,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2015-03-18T07:50:05Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"priority_id","old_value":"4","new_value":"5"}]},{"id":5079,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-18T07:52:19Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"933"}]},{"id":5089,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"I would suggest to reject this feature since its perimeters is covered by #895 and #933.\r\n\r\nDo you agree ?\r\n\r\n","created_on":"2015-03-18T11:11:52Z","details":[]},{"id":5106,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"Reject or link as 'Solved by #895' ...\r\n\r\nBut I agree","created_on":"2015-03-20T16:49:06Z","details":[]},{"id":5118,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-25T08:17:16Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"7","new_value":"6"}]},{"id":5119,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-25T08:23:44Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"762"}]},{"id":6512,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-09-18T15:24:06Z","details":[{"property":"cf","name":"4","new_value":"-"},{"property":"cf","name":"5","new_value":"-"}]}]}}

(as in v2).\r\n\r\nPlus: it really makes sense to have this in the diffusion screen, as it offers a complete view of diffusion parameters.\r\n\r\n","start_date":"2015-04-07","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":["ASIT-VD (CH)"]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact","value":"None"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact","value":"Extraction manager can be define in 2 views : resource and diffusion."}],"created_on":"2015-04-07T07:16:05Z","updated_on":"2016-03-31T06:18:17Z","closed_on":"2016-03-29T15:22:35Z","journals":[{"id":5209,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"TC accept that enhancement but remarks that that role should be duplicated and not moved.","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:56:36Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"7","new_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"762","new_value":"383"}]},{"id":6822,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-11-26T08:11:24Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"priority_id","old_value":"5","new_value":"4"}]},{"id":7476,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"notes":"","created_on":"2016-03-29T15:22:19Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"9","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"383","new_value":"23"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"179"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"},{"property":"cf","name":"4","new_value":"None"},{"property":"cf","name":"5","new_value":"Extraction manager can be define in 2 views : resource and diffusion."}]},{"id":7477,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"notes":"","created_on":"2016-03-29T15:22:28Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"23"}]},{"id":7478,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"notes":"","created_on":"2016-03-29T15:22:35Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"10"},{"property":"cf","name":"3","new_value":"ASIT-VD (CH)"}]}]}}

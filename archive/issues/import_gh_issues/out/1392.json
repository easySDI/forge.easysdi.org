We propose to remove the \"fee without a pricing profile\" pricing method\r\nWhy ?\r\n\r\n* *No use*\r\n** At ASIT VD we were the last know users of this pricing method\r\n** Our providers have now moved to the \"pricing profile\" method for all the products\r\n* easySDI would *offer a finite/known basket price for every order* if we remove the feature\r\n* *Large simplification* in code and apprehension of the application\r\n** No more estimate !

This text is displayed as a tooltip when cursor is passing above title of a class or attribute.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to improve and ease the task of editors by adding, beside \"text\" and \"locale\" stereotype, a list of suggestions definable by the admin in the backend. \r\n\r\nSimilar help is proposed in Geosource here (Suggestion simple) : http://www.geosource.fr/docs/editor/new_metadata/index.html#suggestion-simple\r\n\r\n\r\n_PS : note that this suggestion mechanizm is different from stereotype \"list\", \"textchoice\" or \"localechoice\" where editors can only choose among a list, whith no change of content possible._\r\n\r\nThis would dramatically help editors and favorize more homogenous contents.\r\n\r\nAny comment/proposal on this issue will be appreciated.","start_date":"2011-10-28","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2011-10-28T10:32:12Z","updated_on":"2014-03-26T21:31:37Z","journals":[{"id":1776,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"Render types \"textBox\" and \"textarea\" should be also concerned by this suggestion mechanism.","created_on":"2011-10-28T10:39:31Z","details":[]},{"id":2774,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:30:45Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"6","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"64"}]},{"id":2781,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-03-26T21:31:37Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"17"}]}]}}

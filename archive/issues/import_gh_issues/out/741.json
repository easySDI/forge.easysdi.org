That means that only the selected provider car use this property for his products.\r\nBut *any user* view, and can use the property when placing an order.\r\n\r\n*In v4*, the property is correctly restricted to the selected organism (as provider), but is ALSO limited for users when adding the product to the basket. That means that a non logged user, or a user form another organisms cannot use this property.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for ASIT VD, is it a bug or a feature?","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":2,"name":"Affected version","value":"151"}],"created_on":"2014-06-11T14:03:18Z","updated_on":"2015-09-18T15:18:21Z","closed_on":"2014-07-04T13:47:25Z","journals":[{"id":3507,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"If no one disagree, I suggest to stick to V2 behaviour and, therefore, change the current code.\r\n\r\nPlease add any comment if you disagree :-)","created_on":"2014-06-16T14:17:10Z","details":[]},{"id":3567,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"I confirm that it's a bug and not a feature :-(\r\n","created_on":"2014-06-25T07:37:42Z","details":[]},{"id":3569,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"Thanks for correcting this behaviour.","created_on":"2014-06-25T08:34:45Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"383"}]},{"id":3637,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-06-27T21:34:14Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"2"}]},{"id":3664,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"In my sandbox: /easysdi/sandboxes/asit-vd/4.2.x/com_easysdi_core/src/administrator/libraries/easysdi/catalog/cswmetadata.php","created_on":"2014-07-01T09:13:43Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"383","new_value":"761"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"151"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"},{"property":"cf","name":"2","old_value":"142","new_value":"151"}]},{"id":3694,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-07-04T13:47:25Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"10"}]},{"id":3724,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-07-11T09:59:57Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"151","new_value":"154"}]},{"id":4426,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-12-12T16:00:34Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"154","new_value":"159"}]},{"id":6390,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"created_on":"2015-09-18T15:18:21Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"761"}]}]}}

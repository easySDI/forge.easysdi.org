One if \"geographicextent\" which existed already in V2 but has not yet been totally coded in V4.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing ?\r\n\r\n- the capability to choose multiple extents (perimeters) from a list to fill a single list of \"selected perimeters\" (without adding new occurences in the MD edition form, as it works now)\r\n- the geographicIdentifiers (ISO) of the perimeters (stored in predefined perimeters) is not saved in metadata\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should be added to cover the same functionnality as available in V2.\r\n\r\nSee in attachement screenshot of what is available in V2 (GUI could be enhanced, see proposal below)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOpen questions :\r\n\r\n- in V2, there was only one stereotype with options. Should we do like this again or code another stereotype something like \"geographicExtent_multiple\" ?\r\n- GUI was not perfect in V2 for searching predefined perimeters in the list). See in attchement our proposal to have a more \"user-friendly\" form (mainly, it adds a search on the multiselect as proposed in JUI since Joomla! v3). See proposal animated in GIF attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":2,"name":"Affected version","value":"138"}],"created_on":"2014-05-27T14:28:21Z","updated_on":"2015-09-18T15:15:44Z","closed_on":"2014-11-03T08:41:23Z","journals":[{"id":3571,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"@Bruno @Thomas @J\u00e9r\u00f4me\r\n\r\nAny input on open questions ?","created_on":"2014-06-25T09:11:19Z","details":[]},{"id":3590,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-06-26T09:25:33Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":3697,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-07-04T15:17:46Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"tracker_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"1"},{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"761"},{"property":"cf","name":"2","new_value":"138"}]},{"id":3720,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"After phone call with Marc and discussion at ASIT VD, *we all agreed on a simplified version of this stereotype*:\nIt will be a simple multiselect with choosen, plus customization:\n* as in v2, items label will contain their type (ex:  \"Bex [Commune VD]\")\n* items will stack vertically (all the same size)\n* container will have a max height (because we can have hundreds of items selected see \"here\":http://tof.canardpc.com/view/a8a3fd1c-ff19-45c6-89a0-c3b1fb30742f.jpg)\n* selected items will be alphabetically sorted (on opening , and when adding new ones)\n* initial size of select is standard (see \"here\":http://tof.canardpc.com/view/efd79b2b-7a71-4fd3-8ac5-44221243fc3c.jpg)\n* selected items are visible in the dropdown but disabled (see \"here\":http://tof.canardpc.com/view/ed64f70f-b25a-44aa-af9b-935af6105308.jpg)\n* not visible here, but we'd like that the placeholder remains visible even if some values are selected\n\nSample fiddles:\n\n(blank select, like in a new MD)\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/M7Td2/\n\n(preselected values, linke a metadata update)\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/K6U4C/","created_on":"2014-07-08T08:54:06Z","details":[]},{"id":3723,"user":{"id":761,"name":"Battaglia Marc"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-07-11T09:28:48Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"}]},{"id":3762,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-07-12T17:10:58Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"10"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"761","new_value":"9"},{"property":"cf","name":"2","old_value":"138","new_value":"155"}]},{"id":3842,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"Need some explanations as feature haven't been developed as initially mentioned...","created_on":"2014-07-17T20:31:21Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"10","new_value":"1"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"9","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":3843,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"Hi Yves,\r\n\r\nIf I understand well, could you please summarize what needs to be done for finalizing issue as initially described, or keep we such integration as is ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nBruno","created_on":"2014-07-17T20:33:21Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"383"}]},{"id":3850,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Remain points:\r\n* items will stack vertically (all the same size)\r\n* container will have a max height (because we can have hundreds of items selected)\r\n* initial size of select is standard\r\n* we'd like that the placeholder remains visible even if some values are selected\r\n\r\nProblem is, we use joomla default chosen, and it doesn't inherit classes from original select.\r\nSo we can't add CSS and js on an object we don't know.\r\nWe'll have to find a trick for this.\r\n\r\nMarc told me that he doesn't have time for this feature anymore.

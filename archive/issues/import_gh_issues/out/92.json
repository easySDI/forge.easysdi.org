But often, for a given user, the geographic restriction is the same (ex.: for a commune).\r\n\r\nA nice functionnality to add would be to be able to define a \"default geographic restriction\" for each user and then give the possibility to assign this default restriction to given policies. \r\n\r\nTo discuss... may be not so clear...\r\n\r\n\r\n ","start_date":"2009-11-19","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2009-11-19T08:38:25Z","updated_on":"2014-03-26T21:35:14Z","journals":[{"id":468,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"It appears that this evolution is not straighforward with current architecture.

First of all, what kind of request is it (GetCapabilities, GetMap...)? if it's a GetMap, with which parameters (1,2,3 layers... width/height ?).

Which means that we propose to:\r\nExpand the functionality of the Monitor to be able to both handle simultanious requests and report collectively on the requests see Monitor issue #275\r\nAdd functionality that can filter the 10% worst request out of the reports\r\n\r\nIt is our assessment that if any additional needs arises from the INSPIRE quality of service discissions.

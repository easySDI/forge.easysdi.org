It is OK when the data has a public access scope. But if access scope is \"private\", the URLs remains accessibles for any one who knows the URL.\r\n\r\nProposition : add a proxy feature to hide remote URLs and secure them (ask for login/password)","start_date":"2014-03-14","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic

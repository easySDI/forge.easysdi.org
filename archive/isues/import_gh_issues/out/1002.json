The result is the loss of hierarchical navigation:\r\n- breadcrumb doesn't work\r\n- menus items aren't \"active\"\r\n\r\nWorking example:\r\nIf we edit a resource the hierarchy is kept: menu_entry -> resources -> one resource\r\n\r\nNon working example:\r\nIf we edit a diffusion we move from com_easysdi_core to com_esysdi_shop, and loose itemid. Navigation is broken.\r\n","start_date":"2015-05-11","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":2,"name":"Affected version","value":"138"}],"created_on":"2015-05-11T08:07:54Z","updated_on":"2016-09-05T12:18:31Z","closed_on":"2016-09-05T12:18:31Z","journals":[{"id":7936,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"This not possible because of easySDI multi-component architecture.\r\nUsers that want to have visual continuity or working breadcrumb must hack their own way around.","created_on":"2016-09-05T12:18:31Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"}]}]}}

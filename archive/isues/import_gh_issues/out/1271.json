We cannot guarantee that current Joomla version runs properly on PGSQL\r\n* Third party software is very rarely supported on PGSQL, so a user of Joomla/easySDI on PGSQL would not be able to take advantage of market modules/plugins/components.","start_date":"2016-02-22","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":["ASIT-VD (CH)"]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact","value":"* End of support of PostgreSQL in easySDI.\r\n* Improve easySDI global quality by only delivering tested software."},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact","value":"-"}],"created_on":"2016-02-22T15:49:44Z","updated_on":"2016-03-31T06:18:18Z","closed_on":"2016-03-31T06:12:46Z","journals":[{"id":7347,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"PSC agree with laying aside PGSQL support in easySDI solution.","created_on":"2016-03-04T08:38:42Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"7","new_value":"11"}]},{"id":7348,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"SC (Xavier, Laurent, Bruno) has voted for such removal","created_on":"2016-03-04T08:42:10Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"11","new_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"282","new_value":"762"}]},{"id":7391,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2016-03-18T09:22:02Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"12"},{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"9","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"762","new_value":"383"}]},{"id":7426,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"I have looked up for postgresql in code...

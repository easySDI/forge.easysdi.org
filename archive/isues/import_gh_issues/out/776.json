May be you are totally sure that your proposal won't break any other existing feature :-)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","created_on":"2014-07-21T11:34:20Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"383"}]},{"id":3856,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Hi Bruno,\r\n\r\nWorking on #770, I saw that other views/features are checked, such as \"preview\" (map), \"download\" and \"add to basket\".\r\nMetadata sheet is the only one that I saw with this problem.\r\nCertainly not checked, because links are not shown if not logged in (no results in search)\r\n","created_on":"2014-07-21T11:40:45Z","details":[]},{"id":3863,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"OK, thanks for your explanations.\r\nWe can go ahead as you proposed.","created_on":"2014-07-23T09:15:36Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"383"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"114","new_value":"156"},{"property":"cf","name":"2","old_value":"155","new_value":"142"}]},{"id":3919,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"in my sandbox: svn://127.0.0.1:13690/easysdi/sandboxes/asit-vd/4.2.x","created_on":"2014-07-30T14:00:17Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"383","new_value":"761"}]},{"id":3925,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-07-30T14:02:41Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"}]},{"id":3997,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-08-14T09:11:44Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":3998,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Revision 7199","created_on":"2014-08-14T09:11:53Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"10"}]},{"id":4442,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-12-12T16:01:26Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"156","new_value":"159"}]},{"id":6402,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"created_on":"2015-09-18T15:18:27Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"761"}]}]}}

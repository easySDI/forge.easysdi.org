Does this proposal will cover this task ?\r\n* this cross-database compliancy means that any new developement must be tested with the three database (it means all developers needs the three environment). I see a problem here : how can we get this done for any new dev. or change ?\r\n* strategy : do you plan to override Joomla framework for requests which needs adaptations ? or do you plan to commit change to the J! framework ? the second option would be better if we think in long-term, no ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answers.\r\n\r\nXavier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_on":"2014-03-26T14:58:39Z","details":[]},{"id":2740,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"# cross-database compliancy will cover:\r\n\r\n * cross-database compliance of each easySDI Joomla installer\r\n * cross-database compliance of all easySDI Joomla extension\r\n * cross-database compliance of all easySDI Java servlets\r\n# yes, it will imply that easySDI must be fully compliant with cross-database functionality (PHP and JAVA) since 4.1.0 version; on our side we have implemented a development environment which contains the three databases where each new feature should be tested; unfortunately I don't see any other way to do it except implementing a fully functional continuous integration platform (which implies also tasks for implementing functional tests and unit tests to regularly play); the \"common\" database for development is MySQL but cross-database compliance should be verified before integration process...\r\n# we have already analyse impact of potential cross-database incompatibility for specific SQL requests; such requests can always been sent directly (regarding the source database) without overriding or hacking JDatabase object","created_on":"2014-03-26T15:20:38Z","details":[]},{"id":2741,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"OK, thanks.\r\n\r\nFor me, the main \"cons\" for this cross-database is with point 2.\r\n\r\nI warn everybody with this second point : it will increase development time AND, even more, testing time for every new feature with SQL code.\r\n","created_on":"2014-03-26T15:56:56Z","details":[]},{"id":2742,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"I go for it \r\n+ 1","created_on":"2014-03-26T15:57:08Z","details":[]},{"id":2890,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"As CORE component contains already all PHP and Javascript API dependencies about easySDI, it is much more convenient to also centralize all SQL procedures (insert, update, delete) in the CORE installer.

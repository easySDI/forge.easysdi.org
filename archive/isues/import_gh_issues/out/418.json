But by doing this directly in the PROXY, it may ease the discover process for specific use or application._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are ideas... to develop !\r\n","start_date":"2011-06-23","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2011-06-23T13:38:11Z","updated_on":"2016-02-03T15:15:33Z","closed_on":"2016-02-03T15:15:33Z","journals":[{"id":1805,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"They seems to develop this kind of filters in Geonetwork, see here :\nhttp://trac.osgeo.org/geonetwork/wiki/proposals/VirtualCSW","created_on":"2011-11-18T15:35:57Z","details":[]},{"id":2876,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:35:15Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"65"}]},{"id":3957,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-08-03T18:20:52Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"15"}]},{"id":7186,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"This is now supported by easySDI (v4):\r\n* Some by system (like geographic extent)\r\n* The other by custom CSW search fields","created_on":"2016-02-03T15:15:33Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"}]}]}}

If the key is not available on the PROXY server (or not uptodate),  the remote server will return an error and the PROXY will trace it in its logs (see \"issue\":http://forge.easysdi.org/issues/show/352) BUT the final client will have no information. More over, a PROXY will multi-server will not respond to any of the request even if other servers give correct responses.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with this, the PROXY should handle the following case :\r\n\r\n- in a \"restrictive error\" mode, the PROXY should return the following OGC exception with the alias of the concerned remote server :\r\n\r\n   <Exception exceptionCode=\"ResourceNotFound\">\r\n      <ExceptionText>\r\n       _some text explaining the error, for example \"unable to find valid SSH certification\"_ \r\n      <ExceptionText>\r\n   </Exception>\r\n\r\n- in \"permissive error \" mode, the PROXY should behave as usual -> the error is not returned to the client if others remote servers answer correctly.\r\n\r\n_This is a transversal evolution to apply to every connectors !_ \r\n\r\n","start_date":"2011-04-01","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2011-04-01T16:19:25Z","updated_on":"2017-06-29T07:25:33Z","closed_on":"2017-06-29T07:25:33Z","journals":[{"id":2872,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:35:15Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"65"}]},{"id":3955,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-08-03T18:19:04Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"15"}]},{"id":8248,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Proxy does not support SSH anymore.\r\nSSL/TLS is supported, and Tomcat/Java security policies are applied to proxy.","created_on":"2017-06-29T07:25:33Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"}]}]}}

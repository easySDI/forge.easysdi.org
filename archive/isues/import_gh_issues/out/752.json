Even if price could be decreased (but potentially it's not always the case), a user must normally confirm his order seeing the final basket conditions.\r\nSo I won't bring such possibility that imposes also to develop a new easySDI basket login page.\r\nI guess that displaying Joomla default login module is sufficient and several ways could be choose (module inside the basket page, module as a div, module in a new page, ...). I have some preference for a div as basket page contains already lot of content to incorporate login form...\r\n\r\nBruno\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_on":"2014-06-26T15:05:17Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"7"}]},{"id":3648,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Adapted with Bruno's remarks.","created_on":"2014-06-30T11:45:10Z","details":[{"property":"attachment","name":"732","new_value":"new_basket_flow_v2.png"},{"property":"attr","name":"description","old_value":"We'd like to have an alternate flow for basket login.\r\nThis need comes from the online price calculation:\r\n\r\n*Current flow:*\r\n\r\n# a user is not logged in and see his basket with products\r\n# click on \"order\"\r\n# log in and confirm\r\n\r\n\r\n> *Problem*: he never sees the updated basket with new prices (depending on his organism category) with eventually free products and rebates.\r\n\r\n*Proposed flow:*\r\n\r\n# a user is not logged in and see his basket with products\r\n(the \"accept terms and conditions\" buttons is now placed at the bottom of basket)\r\n# the button at bottom of basket is \"login\" (or create account), he clicks on it\r\n# the Joomla! login page if offered to him, he logs in\r\n# the basket is shown again with new prices depending of his organism categories\r\n# now the buttons at bottom are \"confirm order\" and/or \"ask for estimate\" and \"save basket\"\r\n# when he clicks on \"confirm order\" or \"ask for estimate\" the order is sent (no more confirmation screen)\r\n\r\n> *Pros* : \r\n> - The user sees the basket with correct/final price\r\n> - If a user is logged in before he goes to his basket, he can confirm an order in one single step (Nr 6)\r\n> - The Joomla!

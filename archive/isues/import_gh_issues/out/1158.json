For that we need:\r\n* Ensure we have consistent URLs (adding GET URL, not only POST) known by users that have access to the download page\r\n* Allow HTTP authentication to download the files (does not log the user in, just allow a single access)\r\n\r\nExample use case (with grid):\r\n* The state (canton) grant an organism category (communes) to download a dataset using zoning.\r\n* The users (communes) want to use this to update their local datasets by scripting the download and update\r\n* The first time, the user has to go to the zoning/grid download page, he can download the file and get the download URL to be reused after having accepted the conditions\r\n* He now can use this direct link with an HTTP basic authentication to get the file file by using a script\r\n\r\n\r\nGet the direct link after accepting the conditions:\r\n!get_direct_link_from_grid.png!\r\n\r\nAlternative: the download button link contains the direct link (updated by jQuery when user accepts the terms and conditions) -> no need for displaying the link","start_date":"2015-10-08","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact","value":"A file offered by shop can be downloaded via programs/scripts using HTTP auth and constant known URLs"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact","value":"Display the direct link to the user (optional, what do you think ?)"}],"created_on":"2015-10-08T09:00:13Z","updated_on":"2015-11-13T14:16:01Z","closed_on":"2015-11-09T09:33:51Z","journals":[{"id":6557,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-10-08T09:20:46Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"1159"}]},{"id":6559,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-10-08T09:20:56Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"1160"}]},{"id":6562,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"+1","created_on":"2015-10-08T09:36:28Z","details":[]},{"id":6565,"user":{"id":16,"name":"Portier Thomas"},"notes":"Just some questions:\r\n- do you have several partners that need this functionnality\r\n- don't you think a wfs webservice should be more appropriate?","created_on":"2015-10-12T22:15:50Z","details":[]},{"id":6567,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Hi Thomas,\r\n* for now our main provider (the state) will use the grid to give secured free access for the municipalities.

It does not allow to type a long text in an easy way, especially if ones would like to add simple HTML anchors like <br>, <b> or <i>\r\n\r\nA multiline field was added for Joomla! 1.5 (see #501)\r\n\r\nA better enhancement (but incompatible with J! 1.5) would be to add some simple features for text formatting like below :\r\n\r\n!mootools-MooEditable-simple.PNG!\r\n(example with MooEditable, done with Mootools -> http://cheeaun.github.com/mooeditable/)\r\n\r\nQuestions from Bruno to be addressed before doing it :\r\n\r\n\r\n* How do you plan to implement loading new Mootools API version and MooEditable API; there is a global way in EasySDI V2 of adding multiple Javascript API with a common loader and it would be nice to use such mecanism, if there isn't any some problem with such logical. Can you tell us more about that?\r\n* Joomla 2.5 integrates Mootools 1.4 so such functionality will be normally available with EasySDI V3; is it correct?\r\nWe should not forget to remove Mootools 1.3 version in EasySDI V3; can you please add such issues affected to CATALOG V3?\r\nCan you please confirm that such new feature will be applied only to edition tooltip\r\n* Is there no way using any Joomla editor (tinyMCE, JCE, ...) for such feature?\r\n","start_date":"2012-04-04","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2012-04-04T11:29:05Z","updated_on":"2017-06-19T08:30:23Z","closed_on":"2017-06-19T08:30:23Z","journals":[{"id":2102,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"","created_on":"2012-04-04T11:29:56Z","details":[{"property":"attachment","name":"490","new_value":"mootools-MooEditable-simple.PNG"}]},{"id":2777,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:30:45Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"6","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"64"}]},{"id":2784,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-03-26T21:31:37Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"17"}]},{"id":8220,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Irrelevant in Joomla 3.x as we should not inject HTML in tooltips","created_on":"2017-06-19T08:30:24Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"}]}]}}

Metadata will be filled in with texts written in a different language than the one specified in metadata language property...\r\n\r\nI propose that language title is not displayed if the default metadata language AND the current language interface (backend / frontend) is the same.\r\n","created_on":"2012-04-03T10:29:01Z","details":[]},{"id":2141,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"+1\r\n(specific use case will be takend in account","created_on":"2012-06-05T10:13:38Z","details":[]},{"id":2776,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:30:45Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"6","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"64"}]},{"id":2783,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-03-26T21:31:37Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"17"}]},{"id":3960,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"Old ticket has already passed the vote...","created_on":"2014-08-03T18:43:04Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"11"}]},{"id":3961,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-08-03T18:43:12Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"11","new_value":"9"}]},{"id":3972,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2014-08-03T19:32:41Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"114"}]},{"id":4831,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"created_on":"2015-03-04T21:49:59Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"114"}]},{"id":4838,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"It seems that this feature has been implemented in v4, am I wrong ?","created_on":"2015-03-05T08:40:15Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":4842,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"Hi Yves,\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't know if it was or not already implemented.\r\nAs this issue is accepted, not affected, and not targeted to any version I've removed the \"unplanned\" target version.\r\n\r\nI propose that such question is discussed during next TC meeting.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n","created_on":"2015-03-05T20:16:20Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"762"}]},{"id":4856,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"notes":"Solved!","created_on":"2015-03-06T09:15:30Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"9","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"762","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"138"}]},{"id":4957,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-06T22:13:59Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"}]},{"id":4958,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-06T22:14:18Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"10"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"9"}]},{"id":6421,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"created_on":"2015-09-18T15:22:28Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"9"}]}]}}

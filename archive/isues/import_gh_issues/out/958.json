Orders\r\n\r\nThe goal is to:\r\n* add readability to this view (one the most used in our platform !)\r\n* gain space for orders name that can be very long (\"Project 588423.335 east side ground plan + elevation\")\r\n* make it look like other list views in easySDI\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges are:\r\n* Add the request id, as it is used by many users to communicate with providers or platform managers (especially since order names can be auto generated...)\r\n* Replace the datetime by a simple \"<n> <time unit> ago\" like \"2 hours ago\" \"or 3 days ago\". We keep precise date and time in the tooltip.\r\n* Merge the type and status column\r\n** If the request is an order or an estimate : show the status (send, validation, received...)\r\n** In the order has at last one product with a response, add the number of product in the label: \"(1/5)\"\r\n** If the order a draft : show \"draft\" in the column (a draft cannot have specific status)\r\n** To maintain the visible difference between an order and an estimate, we propose to mark only the estimates (as it is a very small pert or all requests) with an icon and a text\r\n* use \"btn-primary\" instead of \"btn-success\" for action button (same as all views in FE) (brow in my screenshot, but blue if default bootstrap is used)\r\n* Actions buttons is always present, as with #957 we propose to allow an order or estimate copy at anytime\r\n\r\nList before:\r\n!orders_before.png!\r\n\r\nList after:\r\n!orders_after.png!\r\n\r\nh2. Requests\r\n\r\nThe goal is to:\r\n* add readability to this view\r\n* make the important information visible first\r\n* gain space for orders and organisms name\r\n* make it look like other list views in easySDI, specially with the orders view\r\n\r\nChanges are:\r\n\r\n* Add the request id, as it is used to communicate with users (clients)\r\n* Only display the type if it's an estimate and drop the column to gain space\r\n* Display the organisms who's made the request, and the account in a tooltip (organism is the primary information, because it defines the pricing etc... user is secondary information)\r\n* Add a \"reply\" button to make it clear (whe had this in easySDI v2)\r\n* Add a \"done/todo\" filter (We had it in V2), very useful for support, with users that have complaints or questions on past requests\r\n** When \"done\" is selected, two additional filters appear (like in v2)\r\n*** A response date from/to filter\r\n*** A client organism filter\r\n*** Those two filters are very important for providers that treat thousands of requests per year !\r\n* Add a \"manual/automatic\" filter (We had this in v2), very useful to track automatic orders with delay, or problems. (Automatic requests are read-only ! )\r\n\r\nList before:\r\n!requests_before.png!\r\n\r\nList after:\r\n!requests_after.png!\r\n\r\n","start_date":"2015-03-27","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact"},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact"}],"created_on":"2015-03-27T10:21:37Z","updated_on":"2015-08-06T09:32:43Z","closed_on":"2015-08-06T09:32:43Z","journals":[{"id":5154,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-27T10:22:27Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"7"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"762"},{"property":"attr","name":"priority_id","old_value":"4","new_value":"5"}]},{"id":5157,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-03-27T11:02:29Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"20"}]},{"id":5205,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"TC remark: use text instead of clip icon","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:38:57Z","details":[]},{"id":5206,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"In case of *1* product, when finished, do not display count.","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:47:07Z","details":[]},{"id":5207,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"For Requests view: display two columns : organism + user.\r\n(Hide one CSS if nedded)","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:52:23Z","details":[]},{"id":5208,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"TC agree this enhancement","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:53:12Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"7","new_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"762","new_value":"383"}]},{"id":5210,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:59:02Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"977"}]},{"id":5212,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"linked to #977, TC remarks that a column must be added to the request list","created_on":"2015-04-10T08:59:35Z","details":[]},{"id":5227,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-04-10T09:52:50Z","details":[{"property":"relation","name":"relates","new_value":"979"}]},{"id":5839,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"Requests view: look and feel: rev 8888\r\nRequests filters : rev 8890\r\norders : rev 8891\r\npatch JS : 8892\r\nFix btn class : 8904\r\nFix URLs in list : 8906","created_on":"2015-08-03T07:58:08Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"9","new_value":"2"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"30"}]},{"id":5840,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-08-03T13:06:12Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"3"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"30","new_value":"100"}]},{"id":5857,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"created_on":"2015-08-06T07:44:05Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"12"}]},{"id":5872,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"created_on":"2015-08-06T07:44:35Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"383","new_value":"787"}]},{"id":5887,"user":{"id":787,"name":"Villemagne J\u00e9r\u00f4me"},"notes":"","created_on":"2015-08-06T09:32:43Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"12","new_value":"10"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"787"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","new_value":"176"}]}]}}

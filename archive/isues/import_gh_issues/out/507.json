The user does not know it before \"flying over\" the title. It's kind of annoying.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to add a dedicated \"pictogram\" (\"?\") which should be only displayed when - and only when - a help content is available. This would ease the work of metadata editors for sur (experience done).","start_date":"2012-02-01","done_ratio":100,"custom_fields":[{"id":3,"name":"Sponsor","multiple":true,"value":[]},{"id":4,"name":"Functional impact","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Ergonomic impact","value":""}],"created_on":"2012-02-01T17:12:19Z","updated_on":"2016-02-03T11:35:48Z","closed_on":"2016-02-03T11:35:48Z","journals":[{"id":2492,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2013-11-26T19:04:20Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"2","new_value":"16"}]},{"id":7145,"user":{"id":383,"name":"Blatti Yves"},"notes":"That can be done by CSS, which gives the ability to every integrator to deal with it as desired.\r\n\r\n(CSS selector : @label[data-original-title]@ or @.com_easysdi_catalog.view-metadata.layout-edit label[data-original-title]@)\r\n\r\nIs it OK for you ?","created_on":"2016-02-03T11:33:09Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","new_value":"17"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"9"}]},{"id":7146,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"Since it can be done by CSS, I reject this issue.","created_on":"2016-02-03T11:35:48Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"},{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"9"},{"property":"attr","name":"done_ratio","old_value":"0","new_value":"100"}]}]}}

When you say \"The DescribeLayer request is not yet supported by the PROXY\", it means that a remote server supporting DescribeLayer request cannot be properly relayed by the PROXY, that's right ?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. When you say \"It must be possible to assign to the wms a new wfs adress\", you mean the PROXY should be able to rewrite the XML response by adding/changing the WFS (or WCS) corresponding to the WMY layer. It it so ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer ;-)\r\n","created_on":"2011-03-17T14:05:34Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","new_value":"16"}]},{"id":1138,"user":{"id":9,"name":"M\u00e9rour Xavier"},"notes":"Thomas, since we are soon putting new contributions into the PROXY, I would like to have your comment on this issue... can you answers my previous questions ? ;-)","created_on":"2011-04-15T08:14:43Z","details":[]},{"id":1147,"user":{"id":16,"name":"Portier Thomas"},"notes":"1. Yes that's right. The DescribeLayer checkbox in the policy admin panel is \r\nalways disabled. That's logical, indeed the describeLayer request gives the \r\ncoresponding wfs for a wms (in geoserver when you had a new layer, it creates a \r\nwms and a wfs with the same data).\r\n2. Yes. We can also imagine to add a login/password to access to this service.","created_on":"2011-04-18T09:39:50Z","details":[]},{"id":2870,"user":{"id":3,"name":"Magoni Bruno"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-03-26T21:35:15Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"project_id","old_value":"3","new_value":"16"},{"property":"attr","name":"category_id","old_value":"1"},{"property":"attr","name":"fixed_version_id","old_value":"65"}]},{"id":2919,"user":{"id":16,"name":"Portier Thomas"},"notes":"","created_on":"2014-04-02T10:08:26Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"status_id","old_value":"1","new_value":"6"}]},{"id":6493,"user":{"id":23,"name":"Van Hoecke H\u00e9l\u00e8ne "},"created_on":"2015-09-18T15:23:46Z","details":[{"property":"attr","name":"assigned_to_id","old_value":"16"}]}]}}

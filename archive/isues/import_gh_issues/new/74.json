(the funtion could also be available for geoservices suppliers ? use RSS feed ?)\r\n"

Same for any access scope in the application.\r\nI would prefer an export facility in contact component with filters (organism,organisms categories, joomla group, etc...), this would be more flexible.\r\n\r\nIs this precise mail feature still a need ?\r\n",

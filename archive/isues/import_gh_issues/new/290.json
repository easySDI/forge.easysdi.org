When you say \"The DescribeLayer request is not yet supported by the PROXY\", it means that a remote server supporting DescribeLayer request cannot be properly relayed by the PROXY, that's right ?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. When you say \"It must be possible to assign to the wms a new wfs adress\", you mean the PROXY should be able to rewrite the XML response by adding\/changing the WFS (or WCS) corresponding to the WMY layer. It it so ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer ;-)\r\n",

That's logical, indeed the describeLayer request gives the \r\ncoresponding wfs for a wms (in geoserver when you had a new layer, it creates a \r\nwms and a wfs with the same data).\r\n2. Yes. We can also imagine to add a login\/password to access to this service.",

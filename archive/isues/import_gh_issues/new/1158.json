For that we need:\r\n* Ensure we have consistent URLs (adding GET URL, not only POST) known by users that have access to the download page\r\n* Allow HTTP authentication to download the files (does not log the user in, just allow a single access)\r\n\r\nExample use case (with grid):\r\n* The state (canton) grant an organism category (communes) to download a dataset using zoning.\r\n* The users (communes) want to use this to update their local datasets by scripting the download and update\r\n* The first time, the user has to go to the zoning\/grid download page, he can download the file and get the download URL to be reused after having accepted the conditions\r\n* He now can use this direct link with an HTTP basic authentication to get the file file by using a script\r\n\r\n\r\nGet the direct link after accepting the conditions:\r\n!get_direct_link_from_grid.png!\r\n\r\nAlternative: the download button link contains the direct link (updated by jQuery when user accepts the terms and conditions) -> no need for displaying the link\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.2"

Since they do it for 300+ municipalities, why not use the same system for the few one(5-10) that want to get the files automatically...\r\n* of course the WFS would the sexy way but:\r\n** some data have legal formats \r\n** some need relational models (with constraints... Like interlis) \r\n** and (afaik) the state does currently not have the infrastructure ",

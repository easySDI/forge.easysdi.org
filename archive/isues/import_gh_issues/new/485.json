I let Bruno giving its point of view.\r\n\r\n*******\r\n\r\nMore generally, I am wondering if we should do this quiclky by going through the GUI... or have a more transversal thought of all EasySDI modules. Indeed, GUI of differents components do not share the same logic of navigation and \"touch and feel\".\r\n\r\nI think we have to discuss this on the EasySDI users meeting on 24. november.\r\n\r\n.",

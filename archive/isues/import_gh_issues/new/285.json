First of all, what kind of request is it (GetCapabilities, GetMap...)? if it's a GetMap, with which parameters (1,2,3 layers... width\/height ?). Do you have any info Thomas ?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(Servercaching)\r\nWhat is as well still unclear to me, a 800*600 pixel GetMap request will most of the time not result in an 470KB map, because of serverside compression. I still dont't have an idea how to interpred this part.\r\n\r\nCSW is 3 Seconds, and so on. See\r\nSee: http:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:0001:0010:EN:PDF",

The discussion about iterpretation has begun in different foras that deals with implementing rules for INSPIRE.\r\n\r\nBut we, at the National Survey and Cadastre Denmark, believe that we can start implementing tools for collecting Quality of Service data and make the functionality flexible to what ever the iterpretation might be at the end of the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Rules stated by Ben Leetz is our starting point. Which means that we propose to:\r\nExpand the functionality of the Monitor to be able to both handle simultanious requests and report collectively on the requests see Monitor issue #275\r\nAdd functionality that can filter the 10% worst request out of the reports\r\n\r\nIt is our assessment that if any additional needs arises from the INSPIRE quality of service discissions. These can be implemented at that time.",

Because of the limitations that it creates for future possibilities.\nNew clients with other SLA needs than the ones implemented on specific jobs might want to see how we have performed historically in relation to their specific SLA needs.\nThis can be acchieved per logging availability and performance 24\/7\/365 for all jobs created.",

I think it will be more simple than associate an icon to the ressource type in EasySDI. Do you suggest that also to change the search field in catalog search?\r\n\r\nOrdering column by clicking on the column name would be great.\r\n\r\nYes, the status \"deleted\" can be dropped.\r\n\r\n",

Why not use the alias of ressource type (maybe prefixed, to avoid collisions) \r\n- this solution won't impact users that wont use the feature\r\n",

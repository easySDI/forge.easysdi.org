Then the user can test the URL Access.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this feature only test the domain name :\r\n\r\n- if I test www.easysdi.org, it returns \"The resource is accessible thanks to the information provided\"\r\n- if I test \"easysdi.org\/fffff\" (which is HTTP error 404), the test returns a \"The resource is accessible thanks to the information provided\". It should return an error message (\"The resource is accessible thanks to the information provided\").\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.1"

What about FTP ?\r\n* Return an object with:\r\n** Success (true\/false) : _true_ only if file is reachable\r\n** Code (200, 404, 403, ...)\r\n** Message ('Found','Not found','Forbidden',...)\r\n* The user of the library can use only the status, or can give a more detailed message if needed (code  + message)\r\n* I would suggest that this library does not carry any translations",

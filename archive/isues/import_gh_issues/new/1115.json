So one metadata can be attached to more than one resource's version (sic).\r\n\r\nTo prevent such error's case, adding unique constraint over the field which contains metadata guid could be a good option to keep database coherence. In addition, easySDI should verify such uniqueness without falling down. If generated guid is not unique than easySDI should generate other one until it is unique.\r\n\r\n"

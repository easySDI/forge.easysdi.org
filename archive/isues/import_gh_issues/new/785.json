Openlayers can transform coordinates by itself between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:900913 but can not handle others SRS.\r\n\r\n- Proj4js library version currently embedded in EasySDI project (1.4.1), and used for extent definition in the metadata form, is not compatibe with the version of OpenLayers used in the map.\r\n\r\n- OpenLayers version used in the map (2.12) has a bug (managment of reverse axis order for WMS 1.3.0) which is always ran when SRS other than the 2 mentionned above are used. This bug is corrected in v2.13 (which is also not compatible with Proj4js 1.4.1).\r\n\r\nCorrection made :\r\n1\/ Replace OL 2.12 by OL 2.13 in the MAP. \r\n2\/ Add Proj4js 1.1.0 to EasySDI project.\r\n3\/ Load Proj4js 1.1.0 in the MAP.\r\n\r\nConclusion : \r\nWe now have 2 versions of Proj4js and 2 versions of OpenLayers embedded in the EasySDI project.\r\nWe should replace the use of Proj4js 1.4.1 and Openlayers 2.12 by versions 1.1.0 and 2.13 every where in the project.\r\n",

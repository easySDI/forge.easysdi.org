It should be catalog dependent (as some catalog have different features).\r\nWe can imagine different ways to achieve it:\r\n- XSL\r\n- Have an HTML editable field in catalog object for the \"no result message\" (but we loose support for multilingual, and a translatable field is not appropriate)\r\n- Other ideas ?\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.2"

            "body": "**Original author :** Blatti Yves\n\nAfter TC discussion and some investigations, here are some implementation proposals :\r\n\r\n1) XSL :\r\n* easySDI already needs XSL for results and is considered a complex task in the easySDI installation process, we won't add complexity. \r\n* we don't have data (XML) to pass to processor, so it would be just HTML\r\n* *rejected solution* : is not an interesting way to achieve this\r\n\r\n2) Direct use of translatable :\r\n* field size is between 255 and 500 chars long, we can't store big content in it\r\n* *rejected solution* : not possible due to limitations\r\n\r\n3) Thomas and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne have proposed to use a *Joomla article* (as storage), and point to it (article ID) in the *multilingual field* of a catalog.\r\n* *Pros* :\r\n** This offers the ability to have a full custom content with Joomla article (com_content)\r\n** com_content is available on all joomla installs\r\n** Keeps the multilingual capabilities (with two languages, we would have to set 2 different articles IDs, one in each language)\r\n** Light to implement, easy to understand if clearly documented (tooltips etc...)\r\n** Can be optional:\r\n*** With a default string in Joomla translations ('no result found')\r\n*** If no article id is specified for user language on the catalog, display the default string\r\n* *Cons* : \r\n** When porting easySDI v2 -> v4 we have chosen to avoid this kind of mechanisms previously used in v2\r\n\r\n4) Use a *Joomla plugin*\r\n* *Pros* :\r\n** By default use a string in translations files ('no result found')\r\n** If a plugin (new plugin type) is found, do not display default string, and load plugin content\r\n** No plugin would be delivered with easySDI, but catalog would trigger the event\r\n* *Cons* :\r\n** If someone want to extend the default 'no results' behavior, it becomes +mandatory+ to code a plugin, which is not convenient for integrators\r\n** In multilingual environment, the +plugin has to manage languages AND different catalogs+\r\n\r\n\r\nMy point after looking at those solutions:\r\n*Solution 3* proposed by Thomas and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne seems to be the +easier way to implement AND to use+.\r\nBut are we OK with this mechanism ? (Personally, I am)\r\n\r\n*Thanks to TC member for their replies.*\r\n\r\n\r\n",

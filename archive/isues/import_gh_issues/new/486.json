I have a job that consists of 10 request that are executed every 60 sec. - I have not yet been able to generate a full graph for this job - sometimes nothing shows and sometimes I get 2-4 graphs.\r\n\r\nI can export the data so I believe the data is collected correctly.\r\n\r\nI see two issues\r\n# Graph is not working with large data sets\r\n# Graph area is to small to show 10 requests at one time\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution could either be to fix this in exiting graph component or to find another component that is able to deal with large datasets\r\n\r\nAlll the best\r\nJorgen de Martino"

Another approach would be to say : we keep going with Highcharts for small-medium amount of data and use others tools (offline) to process big amount of data like you have for example.\r\n\r\nNeed to be discussed.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion ?\r\n",

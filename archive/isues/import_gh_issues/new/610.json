        "body": "**Original author :** Magoni Bruno\n\nPdfServlet is a current EasySDI java servlet which allows to export metadata in pdf format based on FOP open source project http:\/\/xmlgraphics.apache.org\/fop\/.\r\nSuch pdf metadata export feature is also available in easySDI based on php MPDF open source project http:\/\/www.mpdf1.com\/mpdf\/index.php\r\n\r\nHaving deployed several metadata catalogues with both technologies, our feedback is that deploying\/manipulating FOP is more painful than using MPDF. Also using FOP inside easySDI does not increase time response when generating metadata in pdf format.\r\nSo we propose to remove FOP java API and to keep pdf export feature through MPDF php API only.\r\n\r\nMay I ask EasySDI Steering Committee to give back his advice and vote about removing PdfServlet ?\r\n+1 = remove PdfServlet from EasySDI v3\r\n0  = no advice\r\n-1 = keep PdfServlet inside EasySDI v3\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nBruno\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.0.0"

        "body": "**Original author :** Blatti Yves\n\nWith easySDI 4.3, the new \"SHOP webservice \":https:\/\/forge.easysdi.org\/projects\/easysdi\/wiki\/4_shop_rest offers the ability to transmit a +binary file+ *OR* +file URL+ (external file).\r\n\r\nProblem is: In case of external file we don't manage a retention time, but files aren't eternal... so we have to remove download link after a while.\r\n\r\nWe propose to add an \"external file retention time\" parameter (as global shop parameter). Values would be days (integer), 0 is \"infinite\" (default).\r\nThis will allow easySDI to remove links from order summaries after the desired time (like we do with local stored files).\r\n"

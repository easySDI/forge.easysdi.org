For example, like we have in build-infos containing svn revision \"4.4.0-r9412\".\r\n\r\n2) I'm not fan of reading the XML, it's a heavy process (and will have to be done maaaany times if you do it like this).\r\n\r\nI would prefer that we write the version somewhere on build, like in PHP file... and why not have it read and store in a singleton style in sdiFactory.\r\nThat way we could use : @$document->addScript('administrator\/components\/com_easysdi_core\/libraries\/easysdi\/view\/view.js?v='.sdiFactory::getSdiBuildVersion());@\r\n\r\n@sdiFactory::getSdiBuildVersion()@ should read the value from file on first call and store it statically for next calls.\r\n\r\n",

'\/js\/easysdi_processing.js?v=' . sdiFactory::getSdiFullVersion());\r\n\r\n```\n\r\n\r\nI have done it for all JS and CSS assets that I have found.\r\n\r\nNote : *We should only do this for easdySDI assets, not for external libraries (jQuery, openlayers, proj, etc...)*\r\nWhy ?\r\n* external libs should not be edited by easySDI devs\r\n* most of them are versioned in the path or filenames\r\n* they may be loaded by cms, framework or other plugin & modules, and they have to keep the simple URL for the Joomla's @addScript@ and @addStyleSheet@ mechanisms duplicate avoidance to work (@url@ is the array's key)\r\n\r\n",

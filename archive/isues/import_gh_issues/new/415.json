Implement such control to prevent a product without diffusion property being orderable should be available.\r\n\r\nThe rule would be : at least one diffusion property must be defined for any product. If not, the \"orderable\" option cannot be set to \"True\" and a red message should indicate the error (omething like \"no diffusion property defined\". \r\n"

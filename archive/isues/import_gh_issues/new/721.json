        "body": "**Original author :** M\u00e9rour Xavier\n\nThe new version of easySDI (V4.x) integrates different types of stereotypes to help to edit metadata. One if \"geographicextent\" which existed already in V2 but has not yet been totally coded in V4.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing ?\r\n\r\n- the capability to choose multiple extents (perimeters) from a list to fill a single list of \"selected perimeters\" (without adding new occurences in the MD edition form, as it works now)\r\n- the geographicIdentifiers (ISO) of the perimeters (stored in predefined perimeters) is not saved in metadata\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should be added to cover the same functionnality as available in V2.\r\n\r\nSee in attachement screenshot of what is available in V2 (GUI could be enhanced, see proposal below)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOpen questions :\r\n\r\n- in V2, there was only one stereotype with options. Should we do like this again or code another stereotype something like \"geographicExtent_multiple\" ?\r\n- GUI was not perfect in V2 for searching predefined perimeters in the list). See in attchement our proposal to have a more \"user-friendly\" form (mainly, it adds a search on the multiselect as proposed in JUI since Joomla! v3). See proposal animated in GIF attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.2.0"

The user does not know it before \"flying over\" the title. It's kind of annoying.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to add a dedicated \"pictogram\" (\"?\") which should be only displayed when - and only when - a help content is available. This would ease the work of metadata editors for sur (experience done)."

Then I want to see the list of children of this particular Version, but I get the list of the latest Versions of children (Status = in Arbeit).\r\n\r\nObviously the Versions get mixed up, or, after choosing the Version of the geoproducht (parent), the list of children is not updated...\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.7"

Is it right or do you think to anything else ?\r\n\r\nAccording to this, the question is which upper version than the minimal one should be supported for all the easySDI PHP code ?\r\nShould the target be aligned with the Joomla Recommended requirements ? In our case easySDI extension should be compliant with PHP 5.3.1+ and 5.4.x but not 5.5.x ?  ",

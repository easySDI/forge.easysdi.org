(ex: http:\/\/www.example.com\/path\/{CODE}.zip)\r\n\r\nThe new field to set URL :\r\n* will be mandatory\r\n* will have a placeholder : http:\/\/www.example.com\/path\/{CODE}.zip\r\n* will use a tooltip like all the other fields (difference with the proposed mockup below) \r\n\r\n\r\nTo allow seamless update for current users of grid download, the URL has to be set to \"{CODE}\" on existing diffusions. So the full url of their services will be used.\r\n\r\n!extend_grid_download.png!\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.2"

If the model in well defined AND the validations rules well described, it should be enough.\n\n\nIn any case, this feature should be implemented as an option (parameters in the backend) since INSPIRE rules does not automatically apply to all catalogs  or part of catalogs (ressource contact for example).\n\nLet's talk about it during next PSC.",

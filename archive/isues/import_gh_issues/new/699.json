For now all roles are automatically filled in when organism property is defined for the first time and adding potential users seems to be a nice option. But we must care about large organism which describes lots of editors (i.e. Bern) and didn't want to remove manually users added with such option... In this case I will add a new button \"Empty roles\".\r\n\r\n* Additionally we have seen that all resource's managers can be removed so we have potentially ghost resources that no one can manage anymore :-(\r\nFor such case, easySDI must force that at least one resource's manager is defined!\r\n\r\nBest Wishes,\r\nBruno\r\n",

I am not sure. I still think it adds some \"noise\" in the form for nothing. Nevertheless, if it is used (who use it?), OK for keeping it.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nState property has been presented in a simple select list as such state can be more than two values (i.e. trash);\r\nfor now only two values are implemented and it could be a cosmetic add-on...\r\n```\n\r\nYes, the cosmetic add-on is welcome :-) By the way, we talk about \"status\"... like the status of the metadata. Should we use another terminology like \"Active yes\/no\" ? (It is confusing for users)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nOrganism selected value could be effectively filled in when only one organism is available, you're right\r\n```\n\r\nThanks :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nRoles accordions are not convenient at all, you're right, and could be removed completely (as I understand in your\r\n proposal why keeping one accordion as there won't be lot of users for each role ?). \r\n```\n\r\nI would keep one accordion because, by default, roles are nots shown : it was the idea of accordion --> \"hidding\" advanced options since roles are defined automatically via organism. By doing like this, this form  remain simple (for a small organisation) BUT offers as well all need advanced options (for big organisation).\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nFor now all roles are  automatically filled in when organism property is defined for the first time and adding\r\npotential users seems to be a nice option. But we must care about large organism which describes lots of editors\r\n(i.e. Bern) and didn't want to remove manually users added with such option... In this case I will add a new button\r\n\"Empty roles\".\r\n```\n\r\nSo we would have two buttons \"add all users\" (means all users who have potential roles) and \"remove all users\". Seems good and covers all use cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\r\nAdditionally we have seen that all resource's managers can be removed so we have potentially ghost resources that no\r\none can manage anymore :-( For such case, easySDI must force that at least one resource's manager is defined!\r\n```\n\r\nYes, easySDI must check that at least one user is defined for each role before saving the form.",

If we want to hide it, we will use CSS.\n- change state property to a toggle.\n- Organism selected value should be filled by default when only one organism is available\n- add two buttons : \"add all users\" \/ \"remove all users\" (users of the selected organism)\n- check that at least one \"resource manager\" is defined (mandatory field)\n- add additional control (see last note https:\/\/forge.easysdi.org\/issues\/699#note-9 )\n\n\nwhat still has to be discussed :\n\n- change the terminology \"status\" to \"Active\" yes\/no (to avoid the confusion with the status of the metadata.\n- about role, definition, I agree we can remove the accordion and use the same layout as in backend BUT keep it in the same tab (not a new one). Why ? because there are interaction between the choise of organism and the users so it should be in the same tab.\n\n\nI hope I did not forget anything... \n\n@Thomas, Bruno, Yves\nPlease add your comment on the \"still to be discussed\" points above. Then we can code  :-)\n\n\n\n",

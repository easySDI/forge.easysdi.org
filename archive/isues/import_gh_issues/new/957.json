It has to be fully re-implemented.\r\n\r\n2015-07-09 EDIT specs with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne:\r\n\r\n* Add an action button in orders lists \"order again\" that will:\r\n** Copy all products in basket\r\n** Copy all products properties in basket\r\n** Copy perimeters in basket\r\n** Copy name + append \" - copy\" (translatable string)\r\n** Copy third party + third party fields (ref, contact, email)\r\n* This copy is formed in a besket in session\r\n* If there is existing products and perimeters in basket:\r\n** ask for confirmation before copy\r\n** if confirmed, drop existing basket content and replace with the copy\r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.2"

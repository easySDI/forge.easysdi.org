Nice!\r\n2: It would *avoid developing some backend\/admin features\/screens*, they could just be added in frontend, only available to this role.\r\nThis logic should be applied, not only to resources, but to other screens, like validation, for example : in the 4.3.x validation process we have mail sent to thrid party. A good admin feature would be \"resent notification\". With this role, no need to add anything in backend.",

This text is displayed as a tooltip when cursor is passing above title of a class or attribute.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to improve and ease the task of editors by adding, beside \"text\" and \"locale\" stereotype, a list of suggestions definable by the admin in the backend. \r\n\r\nSimilar help is proposed in Geosource here (Suggestion simple) : http:\/\/www.geosource.fr\/docs\/editor\/new_metadata\/index.html#suggestion-simple\r\n\r\n\r\n_PS : note that this suggestion mechanizm is different from stereotype \"list\", \"textchoice\" or \"localechoice\" where editors can only choose among a list, whith no change of content possible._\r\n\r\nThis would dramatically help editors and favorize more homogenous contents.\r\n\r\nAny comment\/proposal on this issue will be appreciated."

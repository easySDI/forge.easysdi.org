It contains many information like user, requestTime, RequestLenght, Pre- and PostTreatment, remote address, querystring,...\r\n\r\nThese are usefull information to make statistics and follow services use.\r\n\r\nBUT it needs a lot of storage ressources : we had for example a 300 Mo log file some days ago.\r\n\r\nWe should consider differents options to redure\/optimize log size, like :\r\n\r\n- reduce information stored in logs\r\n- have a less verbose logs structure\r\n- compress\/aggregate logs\r\n- do not logs some user for instance (admin(monitor users...)\r\n- log only certain type of logEntry (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, SYSTEM)\r\n\r\nto discuss...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 3.0.0"

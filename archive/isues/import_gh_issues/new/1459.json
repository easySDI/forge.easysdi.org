See realization of EM91\/archiving in v1.0. Example: @l'ap\u00e9ro.zip -> l_apero.zip@\r\n** The files are uploaded to the temporary folder of the element (output)\r\n\r\nModels\r\n\r\nAdding files and deleting:\r\n\r\n!16831_add_or_delete_files.png!\r\n\r\nIf no file present : \r\n\r\n!16831_add_files_no_files_present.png!\r\n\r\nSelect multiple files:\r\n\r\n!16831_add_multiple_files.png!\r\n\r\nDelete confirm:\r\n\r\n!16831_delete-file-confirm.png!\r\n\r\nNo change possible if processing in progress (active status) or if processing completed\/cancelled:\r\n\r\n!16831_process_complete.png!\r\n\r\n\r\nSource (french) : https:\/\/projets.asitvd.ch\/issues\/16683\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.5.1"

This must be a GN3 bug, because CSW specifications required GetCapabilities in HTTP GET. Work around is : use a preexisting physical service, change the url and authentication informations, but don't perform negociation on it.\r\n* GN3 uses HTTP Basic authentication, we do not need to use anymore the specific provider authentication mecanism\r\n* Conclusion is : some few days are required to adapt easySDI to the new GN3 specificities, but it can be use as it is.\r\n\r\nConcerning the oncoming workshop, with this GN3 compatibility news, the developpment of an internal CSW engine seems to be no more a hot topic. \r\n*TC members have proposed following topics to be discussed :*\r\n# CSW search enhancements :\r\n* Faceted search\r\n* search autocompletion\r\n* multi-criteria search\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n# Extraction features (ASIT-VD)\r\n\r\n# Roadmap easySDI:\r\n* Monitor + services?\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

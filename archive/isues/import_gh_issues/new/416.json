I guess all new UI words are in English at least.\r\nThis is what I see here : http:\/\/forge.easysdi.org\/projects\/monitor\/repository\/diff\/joomla\/1.5\/trunk\/com_easysdi_monitor\/language\/admin\/fr-FR.com_easysdi_monitor.ini?rev=3110&rev_to=2902\r\n\r\nI can do the translation work for french. *Please give me a \"go\" when no more change on localization file will be done*\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.0.0"

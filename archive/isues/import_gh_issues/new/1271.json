        "body": "**Original author :** Blatti Yves\n\nOn February 12th 2016 meeting, Technical Committee proposes to remove PostgreSQL support.\r\nReasons are:\r\n* There is no known user of easySDI running PGSQL\r\n* PGSQL install and updates are not tested in easySDI\r\n* There is (or was) Joomla problems in PGSQL support. We cannot guarantee that current Joomla version runs properly on PGSQL\r\n* Third party software is very rarely supported on PGSQL, so a user of Joomla\/easySDI on PGSQL would not be able to take advantage of market modules\/plugins\/components.\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.4.1"

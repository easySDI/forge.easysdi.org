Could be integrated in the General configuration panel under SHOP tab with two fields :\r\n\r\n1. offline : yes\/no (default is \"no\")\r\n2. if offline, link to a Joomla! article (to give explanation about maintenance issue, duration,etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_PS : same mechanism could be developped for other components with frontend (CATALOG, MAP, PUBLISH,...)\r\nNeed to think on a generic implementation._"

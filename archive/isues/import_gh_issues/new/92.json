But often, for a given user, the geographic restriction is the same (ex.: for a commune).\r\n\r\nA nice functionnality to add would be to be able to define a \"default geographic restriction\" for each user and then give the possibility to assign this default restriction to given policies. \r\n\r\nTo discuss... may be not so clear...\r\n\r\n\r\n "

To fullfil the demand, policies and rights should be stored in a relational database. It implies major changes in the actual PROXY.\r\n\r\nWe will propose things in the next months regarding this issue.",

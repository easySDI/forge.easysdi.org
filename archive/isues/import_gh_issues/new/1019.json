An email notification is send to the validation manager(s) to ask for valoidation. \r\n\r\nThis enhancement consists of adding a second email notification after the validation (or reject). This is usefull because this email will inform all accounts who have the \"validation manager\" role (the same who received the first email notification, before validation). By doing this, all actors are informed before and after validation (or reject).\r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.2"

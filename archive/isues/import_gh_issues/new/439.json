The list should be filtered based on user's rights.\r\n\r\nIt's more cosmetic... but important since a user could see type of objects he cannot access\/create\/modify.\r\n\r\n_For example, if he has only rights on \"objet A\" and \"object B\" and not \"object C\", the list should contains \"object A, object B\"._ \r\n\r\n\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.0.0"

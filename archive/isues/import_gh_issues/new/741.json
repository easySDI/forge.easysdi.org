That means that only the selected provider car use this property for his products.\r\nBut *any user* view, and can use the property when placing an order.\r\n\r\n*In v4*, the property is correctly restricted to the selected organism (as provider), but is ALSO limited for users when adding the product to the basket. That means that a non logged user, or a user form another organisms cannot use this property.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for ASIT VD, is it a bug or a feature?\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.2.0"

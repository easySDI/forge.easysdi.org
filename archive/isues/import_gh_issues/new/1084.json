        "body": "**Original author :** Blatti Yves\n\nWe'd like to propose to the data providers to download an order perimeter (for the \"manual\" extractions).\r\nThis allows them to open the perimeter in their application (GIS,CAD or WEB) to clip the data for the order.\r\n\r\nWe had this in V2, but in a custom code extension. We'd love to see it in easySDI.\r\n\r\nProposed formats are text formats, generated by openLayers or custom code. Formats list:\r\nDXF, used by almost any CAD software (custom code, parsing openLayers features).\r\nGML, can be read by almost any GIS application (openLayers native).\r\nKML, can be loaded in may web apps (openLayers native).\r\nGEOJSON (openlayers native).\r\n\r\nSince we don't have PHP geo libraries, we propose to do it fully client side: generates the features in openlayers and export it via FileSaver.js (1).\r\nHaving it done client side offers the ability to download WFS perimeters as well (since geometries are not available in backend storage)\r\nDXF,GML and GeoJSON would be exported in MAP SRS. KML in WGS84.\r\n\r\nThe download link would be offered in product transmission page only, next to the map.\r\n\r\nThere's a CSS Id for the download block + for each format if you want to hide one or all of them.\r\n\r\nWe have a working code ready.\r\n\r\n!download_perimeter.png!\r\n\r\n(1) https:\/\/github.com\/koffsyrup\/FileSaver.js\n\n**Fixed versions :** 4.3.2"
